# How to use the data

The dataset is very large, so the file links have been uploaded to our team excel sheet. You can access the files using the following link:

[Team Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TUE8CxmUUXf7os1zW0QvrAJHbBSEk98MDjkuxCWRR2I/edit#gid=95930555)

Make sure to download the data and place it in the `Datasets` folder in the root directory of the project.

This ensures that we can share the data with the team and keep it in a central location and not have to ammend the code to point to different file paths.
