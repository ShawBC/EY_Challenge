# EY_Challenge - Storm Damage Assessment

## Project Description

This project aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to develop innovative solutions for assessing the damage caused by tropical cyclones. By analysing satellite imagery and relevant datasets, our goal is to create predictive models that can accurately evaluate the impact of these natural disasters on affected communities, with a focus on coastal infrastructure. This challenge is pivotal for improving disaster response strategies and aiding in the effective allocation of resources for recovery and rebuilding efforts via automation.

## How to navaiagte the repository for team members

Folders:

- `Datasets` - Is where you should store the datasets
- `Sample Notebooks` - Is where the EY provided sample notebooks are stored, read these first
